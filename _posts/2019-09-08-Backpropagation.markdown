Hello everyone! This is my first post on GitHub Pages.
Before explaining my hopes and expectations for this website, I would like to briefly introduce myself.

My name is Fortunato Nucera and I am an aerodynamics engineer. Italian by birth, I moved to Japan at the age of 21 and I have been living here ever since.
In the past year, I have been growing more and more interested in the field machine learning and I have decided to take a few online courses (**Machine Learning** by Stanford, **Deep Learning** by DeepLearning.ai, **Mathematics for Machine Learning** by the Imperial College and, currently, **Deep Learning** on Udacity).

At the moment, I am halfway through my NanoDegree in DeepLearning on Udacity and I thought that sharing concepts and knowledge could be a good way to absorb and really comprehend the underlying equations.

My repository will be available at @tinosai on GitHub.

Next article will be about the equations of backpropagation for Neural Networks.
I am looking forward to a fruitful knowledge exchange.

Ciao!

Tino
