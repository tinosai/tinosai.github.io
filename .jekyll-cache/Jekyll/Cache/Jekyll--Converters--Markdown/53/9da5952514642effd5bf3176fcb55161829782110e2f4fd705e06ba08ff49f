<p>I obtained a B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Milan (Italy) in 2013 and a M.Sc. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the University of Tokyo (Japan) in 2015, with a thesis concerning the optimization of reusable launch vehicles. I am currently pursuing a M.Sc. in Machine Learning and Data Science at Imperial College London.</p>

<p>I believe in constant self-improvement and I am determined to read and learn as much as I can (time allowing).</p>
